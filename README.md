# Epoch
## A simple mod loader for JesusAI
## Created by @schneerocket

Epoch lets you inject as many mods as you want using JesusAI's code base.

Epoch makes the process as easy as possible, including the necessary lines and files JesusAI
checks for during its launching stages. Epoch works by imitating a real JesusAI Cartridge, then
injecting its files into JesusAI, allowing up to 20 custom mods to be launched from the program.

Works as of the current JesusAI version.
