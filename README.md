# Unix Epoch
## A simple mod loader for JesusAI
## Created by @schneerocket

Unix Epoch lets you inject as many mods as you want using JesusAI's code base.

Unix Epoch makes the process as easy as possible, including the necessary lines and files JesusAI
checks for during its launching stages. Unix Epoch works by imitating a real JesusAI Cartridge, 
then injecting its files into JesusAI, allowing up to 20 custom mods to be launched from the program.

Works as of the current JesusAI version. Windows only!

# Tutorial
## Step 1: Download Unix Epoch

You can download Unix Epoch from the releases tab once it's fully released, 
or from the GitHub page.

## Step 2: Download JesusAI

You can download JesusAI [here](https://github.com/JesusAIexperience/JesusAI).
You need JesusAI to even use Epoch anyway..

## Step 3: Rename Unix Epoch

To make Unix Epoch inject properly, you will need to rename it to either "Cartridge 1", 
"Cartridge 2" or "Cartridge 3". Otherwise, Epoch cannot work properly.

## Step 4: Run the JesusAI Cartridges Menu

You can do this by either achieving all 3 endings (the intended way) or access the menu via
the Directories menu in the Debug options.

## Step 5: Launch the corresponding Cartridge number

Launch the Cartridge number which you renamed (e.g. load 1 if you renamed it to Cartridge 1, etc)

## Step 6: Load Unix Epoch

Simply hit enter. If you did everything correct, Unix Epoch should now load properly.

## Step 7: Enjoy your Custom Mods!

You can load the Unix Epoch Mods List by typing "1", exit the program by typing 
"2" or returning to JesusAI by typing "3".
